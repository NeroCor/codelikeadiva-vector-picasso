  instructions: 'First you choose an Source Image. <br/> <br/> This image will then get triangulated and drawen as an Background (no Magic). <br/><br/> After this first triangulation a second triangulation will be performed, but with slightly changed parameters. The Algorithm of drawing the Lines inside these Triangles, is the same as the Algorithm which is used to draw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Constructing_B.C3.A9zier_curves" target="_blank">Quadratic Bezier Curves</a>. <br/>This Mesh of Lines atop of the triangulation gives the Artwork the feeling of depth and details. <br/><br/> Bonus:<br/> You can upload your Image into an Imgur Album'
