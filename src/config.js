The Algorithm of drawing the Lines inside these Triangles, is the same as the Algorithm which is used to draw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Constructing_B.C3.A9zier_curves" target="_blank">Quadratic Bezier Curves</a>. <br/>This Mesh of Lines atop of the triangulation gives the Artwork the feeling of depth and detail. <br/><br/> Bonus:<br/> You can upload your Image into a Imgur Album',
